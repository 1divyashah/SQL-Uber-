 Description:

In this SQL Assignment, we will be working with a simulated dataset inspired by the operations of a ride-hailing service like Uber. The dataset consists of information related to rides, drivers, and passengers. Our goal is to analyze and gain insights from this data using SQL queries and techniques.

Problem Statement:


The objective of this project is to utilize SQL queries and analysis to extract meaningful insights and answer various questions related to the ride-hailing business. We will explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset to provide recommendations and solutions that can enhance the operational efficiency and customer experience of the ride-hailing service.

In our analysis of Uber's Ride-Hailing Operations, we delve into a dataset encompassing three core tables: 'Rides,' 'Drivers,' and 'Passengers'. The 'Rides' table encompasses detailed ride-related information such as ride specifics, driver and passenger identifiers,

pickup and dropoff locations, ride distance, duration, fare amount, and payment methods. The 'Drivers' table encapsulates essential driver attributes including driver ID, name, join date, rating, ride count, and earnings. Lastly, the 'Passengers' table encompasses passenger attributes, such as passenger ID, name, signup date, total rides taken, total spending, and passenger ratings. 

The synergy of these tables mirrors the intricate dynamics of Uber's ride-hailing ecosystem, allowing us to uncover invaluable insights, patterns, and trends. With SQL queries, we're empowered to extract actionable information to optimize operations, enhance driver performance, and improve passenger experiences. By leveraging SQL databases, we ensure data accuracy, streamline analysis, and elevate decision-making to elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of Uber's services.
